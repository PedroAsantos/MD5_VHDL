WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net design_1_i/StreamCopIPCore_0/U0/StreamCopIPCore_v1_0_S00_AXIS_inst/startFor21_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/StreamCopIPCore_0/U0/StreamCopIPCore_v1_0_S00_AXIS_inst/startFor2_reg_i_1/O, cell design_1_i/StreamCopIPCore_0/U0/StreamCopIPCore_v1_0_S00_AXIS_inst/startFor2_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
